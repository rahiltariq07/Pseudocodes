Procedure SquareRoot
    Input: num (a positive number)
    Output: root (approximation of the square root of num)

    // Initialize the initial guess for the square root
    Let guess = num / 2
    
    // Set a tolerance level for the approximation
    Let tolerance = 0.00001
    
    // Iterate until the guess is close enough to the actual square root
    Repeat
        // Calculate the next guess using Newton's method
        Let nextGuess = 0.5 * (guess + num / guess)
        
        // Check if the difference between the current guess and the next guess is within the tolerance
        If absoluteValue(nextGuess - guess) < tolerance
            // If the difference is within tolerance, the current guess is the approximation of the square root
            Set root = nextGuess
            Exit loop
        End If
        
        // Update the guess for the next iteration
        Let guess = nextGuess
    Until false
    
    Return root
